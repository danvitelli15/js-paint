an image (canvas?) is a data structure consisting of layers

layers are a data structure modeling a 2d array of pixels the size of the image being worked on
layers know the color to be stored in given index on that layer
if the color value is null the pixel is considered to be transparent on that layer

displayed color values are the color defined on the highest layer that has that index defined

all canvases will have a base layer that is a predefined single base color that will be the default color that is show if no higher layer has a color defined
